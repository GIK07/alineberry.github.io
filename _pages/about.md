I'm a Data Scientist at Transamerica on the Advanced Analytics team located in Denver, CO. I work on projects spanning an array of subject matters, including natural language processing, deep learning, representation learning, fraud detection, etc. I vet projects during initial stages, perform exploratory data analysis, select and tune model architectures, and write production code.

I started working in machine learning in 2017 after spending the first few years of my career working as a structural engineer designing large industrial steel and concrete structures. I still hold a Professional Engineer license.

This blog is a place where I can write about ideas that interest me so that I can strengthen my understanding as well as share information with others.
